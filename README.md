# E-Commerce-Analytics
This project was made to analyze the superstore data using data visualization tool named "Tableau". The main aim doing this project was to learn how we could get insights using the data and transform the data into visual representations.
We have generated bar chart, highlighted tables, association matrices, filled maps, market basket analysis and scatter plots from the help of a powerful visualization tool to better understand the data while performing analysis.
